# David Thien Week 4 Status Report

## Goals from previous week
- Set up plugin testing (contingent on finishing comment detection feature)
- Integrate with Travis CI
- Create installable package other can download
- Determine how plugin dependencies should work with eclipse marketplace
- Set up basic interface so the front end can call into the backend
- Implement activators so plugin lifetime is automatically managed correctly
- Help set up presentation demo

## Progress this week
- Plugin testing in progress, currently finishing set-up with maven
- Figured out how to intergrate Eclipse testing with Travis, just need to finish up maven tests (previous task)
- Have an installable .jar file for the plugin now
- Plugin dependencies will work through eclipse features
  + Marketplace has to approve plugin, but quick process; this is a FE thing or - more likely - a 3rd respository thing to integrate with eclipse features
- Plugin lifetimes are managed automatically and initialized on eclipse startup

## Goals for next week
- Finish setting up maven/travis for testing
- Figure out how to do testing for editor inputs
- Reoraganize plugin lifetimes (currently pretty messy)
- Finish setting up target for eclipse features installer
- Set up RCP target for maven autobuilds integrating with eclipse featuers
- Coordinate w/ front end to figure out how to do integration testing across the interface
