PROGRESS MADE THIS WEEK
-----------------------
	- Re-prepared presentation materials
		- Including giving presentation in class
	- Implemented a working evaluation function for removing unused import statements
		- Still some limitations. It's slow and clunky, we're looking for optimizations
	- Refined block comment evaluation function
		- As per some suggestions from management:
			- block comment eval triggers off any amount of consecutive commented lines
			- found limitations on determining when user ctrl+/ on single consecutive lines
				- internal document changes look identical to if both lines were
					commented at the same time. So if they did use the block comment feature
	- Worked with front end team to verify interface between plugins works
		- provided a release branch of IDE-IT backend they can use
	- Researched various Eclipse functionality
		- Discovered and utilized IMarkers and IAnnotations

	- Helped research and modify maven build process
