GOALS FROM PREVIOUS WEEK
-----------------------	
	- Tests, tests, tests 
		- Catch up on unit tests where able
		- Figure out and set up integration tests
	- Compose list of sequences of actions users can take that will be used to 
	  evaluate the success of our product
		- A list of actions that we can evaluate our tool against
		- Will interview team members and other students to get a full, varied list	
	- Implement working evaluation function for adding imports
	- Refine evaluation function for removing imports
		- Add unit tests
	- Create documentation and data showing our initial results
		- Using list of sequences of actions users can take, as mentioned above
	
-----------------------
PROGRESS MADE THIS WEEK
-----------------------

	- Implemented evaluation function for adding imports
	- Implemented an abstract FeatureEvaluator class that each feature evaluation function extends
	- Updated manual and report to address feedback
		- Added initial results information
	- Worked on looking for alternative evaluation function possibilities for block comments
		- Trying to simplify evaluation/catch more cases with working prototype
	- Maven script set up for testing
	- Started looking at using the AST for feature evaluators rather than document changes
	- Implemented working scirpt to generate graphs for testing false positives and negatives on feature evaluators
	- Added and refactored unit tests for:
		- Block Comment Evaluator
		- Feature Suggestion Interface 
	- Composed a list of possible actions a user can take 
		- Including interviewing other students to get a more exhaustive list
	- Designed and set up framework for testing against possible false negatives
		- Using the list mentioned previously as the test cases
		- Created 20+ tests that our block comment evaluator can run against

PLANS AND GOALS FOR FOLLOWING WEEK
----------------------------------
	Responsible parties are listed after each goal (or subgoal, where applicable)
	
	- Update manual and report based on any feedback (Eric)
	- Write unit tests for classes of project (All)
	- Possibly implement feature evaluation for correcting indents (Eric)
	- Refine add and remove import evaluations (John/Eric)
	- Finish setting up graph for false positives and negatives on feature evaluators (David)
	- Research and implement using Eclipse API for AST changes (David/John)
		- May be helpful in refining our current evaluators and for future ones
	- Refactor testing code (David)
	- Write more false positive and negative tests (All)
	- Finish converting false negative user test cases to runnable tests (John/All)
 	- Prepare for in class presentation (David/John)
	- Work with FE team to make sure BE infrastructure changes will still integrate with Feature (John)

MEETING AGENDA
--------------
For manager / high level engineer
	- Advice / plan for providing public facing documentation regarding false negative test cases
	- Decide when import evaluation functions should trigger
		- Project wide or open document only
		- Consider changing remove unused import hotkey to suggest a configuration to turn on auto removal upon save (this integrates better with some of the FE functionality)
