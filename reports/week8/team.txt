GOALS FROM PREVIOUS WEEK
-----------------------	

	- Update manual and report based on any feedback
	- Write unit tests for classes of project
	- Possibly implement feature evaluation for correcting indents 
	- Refine add and remove import evaluations
	- Finish setting up graph for false positives and negatives on feature evaluators
	- Research and implement using Eclipse API for AST changes
		- May be helpful in refining our current evaluators and for future ones
	- Refactor testing code 
	- Write more false positive and negative tests
	- Finish converting false negative user test cases to runnable tests
 	- Prepare for in class presentation
	- Work with FE team to make sure BE infrastructure changes will still integrate with Feature

PROGRESS MADE THIS WEEK
-----------------------

	- Finished converting false negative list to mock runnable tests
		- For Block Comment Evaluator only
	- Updated report with information on Initial Results analysis
	- Updated report and user manual based on last week's feedback
	- Started converting false negative list to mock runnable tests for
		- Trailing white spaces
		- Correct Indentation
	- Researched Eclipse API for AST changes
		- Eclipse doesn't have a way to listen for AST changes as we hoped
		- Eclipse allows us to parse our own AST whenever we want instead
	- Designed and implemented working evaluation functions for:
		- correct indentations
		- getters / setters
		- trailing white spaces
	- Improved Add Imports evaluator
		- Simplified code and catches more cases
	- Prepared for in class presentation and gave said presentation
	- Met with FE team to verify integration works
	- Updated success metrics graph script
		- Now works on mac
		- Updated user manual with more specific instructions
