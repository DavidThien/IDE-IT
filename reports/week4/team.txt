GOALS FROM PREVIOUS WEEK
-----------------------
	- N/A (No report was due last week)
	
-----------------------
PROGRESS MADE THIS WEEK
-----------------------
	- Designed and wrote interface design
		- Observer Design Pattern
		- Provided information to Front End
	- Researched various Eclipse plugin functionality and Eclipse APIs
		- Shared resources with team
	- Researched and tested plug in dependency
		- Was able to prove plug in dependency works in a way that allows
			front and and back end to develop separate plug ins. FE will 
			use BE as a dependency and use our service
	- Prototyped reading key inputs
		- This particular method was found to be clunky and unreliable
	- Modified Project Proposal 
		- Rewrote the approach to be BE specific
		- Added architecture design
			- including interface details
	- Infrastructure for IDE-IT backend
		- Discussed and designed
		- Added to Project Proposal
	- Coordinated with teammates to determine a specification for the backend team
	- Installed a basic working plugin framework in Eclipse (a simple "Hello world" example)
		- May be scrapped or modified to be used as our starting framework for IDE-IT BE
	- Learning how to use activators to manage plugin lifetime
		- Had difficulties in having a plug in automatically start upon Eclipse startup
  	- Using JUnit with SWT to to create automated testing of plugins
  	- Integrating JUnit SWTbot test with Travis CI
  	- Set up eclipse version control integration
